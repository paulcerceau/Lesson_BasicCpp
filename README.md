# C++ Basics:

Welcome to the **C++ Basics Workshop**! This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of programming in C++, combining traditional console-based learning with an introduction to graphical programming using Raylib.

During this workshop, we will cover everything from basic syntax to object-oriented design, and even touch on 2D game development by creating a simple Pong game, ensuring that you build a solid foundation in C++ programming. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, this project will guide you through the essential concepts of C++ in a hands-on, practical way.

## Overview

This repository uses the context of a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired character creation to illustrate C++ concepts (described in a separate Powerpoint presentation, not available to the public yet) and help students learn the basics of C++ programming. 
As new concepts are discovered, students can directly see how they can be applied. The project grows as their knowledge expands.

To complement the character creation section and introduce students to graphical programming, we also include a simple Pong game built with Raylib, a C++ graphical library. This game provides a practical and fun way to explore core game programming concepts while applying them in an interactive context.

The material is aimed at beginners and includes:

- An introduction to C++ syntax
- Understanding variables, pointers, data collections, and operators
- Control structures (tests and loops)
- Functions
- Object-oriented concepts
  - Classes, structs, enums
  - Inheritance
- Miscs (reading and writing in files)
- Graphical programming with Raylib
  - Game structure: initialization, update, draw, deinitialization, ...
  - Scene management
  - Basic UI implementation
  - Simple AI / local multiplayer
  - Use of textures, sound effects and background music

By the end of the workshop, students will be able to write simple C++ programs, understand the basics of object-oriented design, and get hands-on experience with creating a 2D game using Raylib.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Teach the basic syntax and concepts of C++ programming.
- Help students understand C++'s application in a D&D-inspired character creation scenario.
- Introduce students to game development fundamentals using Raylib.
- Prepare students for more advanced C++ topics and programming challenges.
