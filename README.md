# C++ Basics: part 1

Welcome to the **C++ Basics Workshop**! This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of programming in C++.

During this workshop, we will cover everything from the basic syntax to writing simple programs, ensuring that you build a solid foundation in C++ programming. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, this project will guide you through the essential concepts of C++ in a hands-on, practical way.

## Overview

This repository uses the context of a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired character creation to illustrate C++ concepts (described in a separate Powerpoint presentation, not available to the public) and help students learn the basics of C++ programming. 
As new concepts are discovered, students can directly see how they can be applied. The project grows as their knowledge expands.

The material is aimed at beginners and includes:

- An introduction to C++ syntax
- Understanding variables, pointers, data collections, and operators
- Control structures (tests and loops)
- Functions
- Object-oriented concepts
  - Classes, structs, enums
  - Inheritance
- Miscs (reading and writing in files)

By the end of the workshop, students will be able to write simple C++ programs and have a clear understanding of how C++ works.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Teach the basic syntax and concepts of C++ programming.
- Help students understand C++'s application in a D&D-inspired character creation scenario.
- Prepare students for more advanced C++ topics and programming challenges.
